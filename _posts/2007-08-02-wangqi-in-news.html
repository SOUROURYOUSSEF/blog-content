Today WangQi told me his photo is selected for a news article. You can find his photo <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ytwaak">here</a>. It just briefly mentions the sales of Windows Vista are good. Well... I am not so sure about it. The sales are not even very high in Europe and about 3 months ago only 400 legal copies of Vista were sold in China.</div>
