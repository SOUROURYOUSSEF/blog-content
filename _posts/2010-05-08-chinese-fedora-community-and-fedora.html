Currently I'm getting ready to move to Beijing (北京), China (中国) in June. While I am still looking for employment I have also been busy with assisting the Chinese Fedora Community (<a href="http://fedora-zh.org/">FZUG/中文用户组</a>). As part of some our activities I will give presentations about Fedora and the community at the <a href="http://beijinglug.org/">BeijingLUG</a>.&nbsp;It is a growing community... but we are still looking for new users, ambassadors and contributors.&nbsp;We would also really like to work together with other other user groups in the APAC.&nbsp;If you are Chinese, in China or interested, drop by in our IRC channel&nbsp;<a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#fedora-zh">#fedora-zh on freenode</a>&nbsp;or get in touch with me (吉拉德,&nbsp;<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Gbraad">gbraad</a>), Caius Chance (<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Kaio">kaio</a>) or Yuan Yijun (袁乙钧,&nbsp;<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Bbbush">bbbush</a>). We are looking forward to seeing you!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="float: right;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Bfzhpk8RTASqZsnLGWonMg?feat=directlink" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-right: 0.5em;"><img border="0" height="141" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_ZmgfsgbGDLs/S-XDomTj1dI/AAAAAAAAITs/PXqKzi0hzFM/s200/fedora-mips.png" width="200" /></a></div>Part of building the Fedora brand, some friends of the Chinese community and I started to port Fedora to the MIPS architecture. MIPS is an architecture that gained a lot of attention recently with the release of the Loongson processor. This processor is Chinese made and ended up in several netbooks and mini-pc's. While they were only available on the Chinese market, they are now being sold in America and Europe, e.g. by the <a href="http://freedomincluded.com/">Freedom Included</a> initiative.<br /><br />Currently we have chosen to target the <a href="http://www.linux-mips.org/wiki/Loongson">Loongson</a> 2F, but in time we will also support other MIPS-compatible processors. The primary goal of this project is to provide support for MIPS as a <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/TomCallaway/SecondaryArchitectures">secondary architecture</a> in Fedora. Just like the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/ARM">ARM port</a>, our secondary goal is to enable derivative distributions based on the Fedora package collection and repository that are more suitably optimized for embedded and mobile use-cases. For this we want to work together with the&nbsp;<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/FedoraMini">Mini SIG</a>&nbsp;as we can both benefit from this.<br /><br />We now have a test build available of <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/MIPS#Test_Release:_Fedora_12">Fedora 12</a>&nbsp;(as n32 mipsel) which should be able to run on Qemu or MIPS-based hardware, like the <a href="http://www.linux-mips.org/wiki/Fulong2f">Fuloong</a>. While we are in the process of fixing some remaining build and technical issues and submitting the patches, you are invited to help us test this release.&nbsp;The Fuloong is currently the platform we build and test on ourselves. Be warned, expect to do some DIY especially since no documentation is available yet... and&nbsp;your mileage may vary.<br /><br /><div style="clear: both;">The team currently consists of me (project-lead), FaiWong (technical lead,&nbsp;<a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Lazyfai">lazyfai</a>) and XinZhen (co-lead,&nbsp;<a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Lonestar">lonestar</a>). If you want to contribute or donate hardware, please get in touch with us. More information can be found on the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/MIPS">Fedora-MIPS wiki page</a>, or just drop by in our IRC channel <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#fedora-mips">#fedora-mips on freenode</a>.</div></div>
