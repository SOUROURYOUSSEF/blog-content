As I mentioned in the <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1008143&tstart=0">Apple Discussions</a> I had issues with the 10.4.10 update of Mac OS X. It seems they finally issued an update for wireless named '<a href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/airportextremeupdate2007004.html">Airport Extreme Update 2007-004</a>'. It says it will improve the reliability. I hope so, since without the power plugged in, the notebook will crash when using wireless! I can accept having a problem with software reliability, since I used Windows a lot for work... but I don't like companies that deny they have a problem. I doubt they completely fixed it. Some reports can be found <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1064085&amp;tstart=0">here</a> and <a href="http://www.macfixit.com/article.php?story=20070801093726999">there</a>.</div>
