But here you can see something funny... :P... It might wobble more than a Aibo, but who cares... the '<a href="http://www.gnome.org/%7Eseth/blog/xshots">wobble</a>' is a Linux feature! The PDA used is a Nokia N800.</p><br /><p><br />More photos from this GUADEC robot can be found <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaeldominic/822735362/">here</a>.<br /></p></div>
