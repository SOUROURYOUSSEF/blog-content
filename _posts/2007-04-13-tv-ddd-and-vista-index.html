Last Wednesday I received my new TV; a <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/gbraad/Computer/photo#5052260035145635170">Samsung 940MW</a>. First of all because of the quality and second because I completely had it with Sony. Their 'service' does not even deserves the word service. When they (Sony) repaired my laptop, <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/gbraad/Computer/photo#5039653114327386546">they scratched it</a>... and even partly repaired it. When they tried it again, they even damaged it more... Eventually I repaired it myself. Probably at the expense of my warranty. But if they provide such a lousy service, all I can do is better than their efforts. But back... why that TV? Well, I only paid €279,- at BestelICT (online webstore). At MediaMarkt they even sold it for €379,-!!! It is the same screen as my two widescreens (<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/gbraad/Computer/photo#5019984966276729986">Samsung 940BW</a>). The quality is VERY good. I had never seen my Amiga with such a bright working experience before :P... or even the Dreamcast. This weekend I will be busy with hanging it on my wall.<br /><br />Recently things go very well at <a href="http://www.sogyo.nl/">my work</a>. We are busy with becoming promoting the use of Domain Driven Design (DDD). One of my bosses, <a href="http://www.edwinvandillen.com/">Edwin van Dillen </a> will be a host speaker at a <a href="http://www.jouwontwikkelingtelt.nl/">seminar for embedded systems</a>, alongside Ivar Jacobson and Markus Völter that is. Also the plans for China are taking shape now. DDD is not a new way of development, but a way of thinking. It places your domain objects in the center of your development effort... I have even used it successfully in a project at  <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/gbraad/Voortman">Voortman</a>. At Voortman they use Beckhoff softplc's that are controlled by a Windows application developed in .NET using C#. The efforts I undertook were related to the foundation of the whole application and assistant applications. The domain objects for product, profile and batch were leading. Around it are services which are responsible for all interactions, from data(base) calls, to processing (pre- and post) to interaction with other machines and their capabilities. Note: some of the articles published by EvD are in Dutch. If really needed, they can be (partly) translated to English.<br /><br />My experience index for Vista... on a scale of 1 to 6, with 6 being the best, it recently dropped from 3 to a meager 2.2. It means that a lot of things are not working the way I expect them to be. On all computers that run it my sound mixer does not open anymore. It shows the main volume, but pressing on Mixer has no effect. Only pressing [Win]sndvol[enter] allows me to interact with the individual volumes of a device. Getting sound from the headphones on my SZ2VP meant I had to change the preferred audio device in  Last.FM and restart the application. My Wacom tablet (on two systems) shouldn't be attached during startup. Else the change that they work is below 50%... tablet application fails during startup. Sometimes restarting the tablet service helps. Tablets are a Graphire3 (CTE-630) and a Graphire4 (CTE-40). I am also not able to find any drivers for the built in webcam of my laptop... I guessed Sony would release them at the end of March. Mostly why I use is because of PowerShell, since I help the project  <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/powershellremoting">PowerShell Remoting</a> and it provides PowerShell as reference for <a href="http://gnome-osh.blogspot.com/">Gosh</a>.</div>
