Last friday I finished the last edits of the CSS for the website of Sogyo. The site had some minor issues with IE6. This might not sound weird... BUT, if I told you the English version of IE6 worked correct, while the Dutch version wasn't?!?!?!? So awkward! I was able to fix it using a forced layout using a zoom: 1; statement. Argh! To see the final result, go to <a href="http://www.sogyo.nl/">www.sogyo.nl</a> or <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/gbraad/Graphics/photo#5089381212972085698">here</a> for a screenshot.</div>
