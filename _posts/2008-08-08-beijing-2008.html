Today, the 8th of August 2008, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Summer_Olympics">Beijing Games</a> will officially open. Most people have heared a lot of negative news about China, but I do not agree on all of it. Really a lot has changed here in Beijing. Just a few days ago I was on Tiananmen... and really noticed the more strict security. On every streetcorner you could see police. It made me feel safe, but also quite unsafe; this I am not used to in Beijing. The air also has dramatically improved. This might be related to having almost no cars on the road. It is really very quite in some roads. Public transport has improved a lot due to having a new metroline for the 3rd ring road and increased amount of buses. I really look forward to the event today and hope these games will be a good one. Note: When I have time I will post my photos on my website and flickr/picasa account.<br /><p><b>Links</b><br/><br />Dutch: check out the NOS coverage of the games at <a href="http://os2008.nos.nl/">http://os2008.nos.nl/</a>.<br/><br />Chinese; broadcast and news at <a href="http://www.cctvolympics.com/">http://www.cctvolympics.com/</a> and <a href="http://2008.sohu.com/">http://2008.sohu.com/</a>.<br /></p></div>
