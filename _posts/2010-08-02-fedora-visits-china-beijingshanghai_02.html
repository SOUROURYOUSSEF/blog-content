A lot of things have happened in China relating to Fedora; our MIPS port gained attention from Loongson and we made Fedora 13 available on our servers. Although it has not been mirrored yet to secondary.fedoraproject.org, you can already try it out. The other thing is about what Kaio and I have been busy with for the last half year, <a href="http://fedora-zh.org/">the Chinese Fedora Community</a>!<br /><br />It seems our efforts have not been unnoticed and the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Community_Architecture">Fedora Community Architecture</a> team <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2010/07/31/mel-in-transit-now-in-china/">sent Mel Chua to China</a>. Yesterday she arrived in Beijing and we immediately started to discuss about our community and future activities and how to gain a more widespread acceptance of Open Source in China.<br /><br />One of the things we immediately agreed upon was, luckily her explanation was less morbid, to '<a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2010/08/01/fedora-china-operation-raptor-proofing/">Raptor-proof our community</a>'. Our community is fragile when it comes to responsibilities and the load carried upon those shoulders. For this to succeed we would like you to propose people or yourself for a role within the community.<br /><br />It would be ideal if some of you would step forward and become a regional ambassador who can represent key regions in China, like Shanghai, Hong Kong, etc. The workload for this is low and when we can balance it out it would even be minimal. You would take care of distributing Fedora swag, like t-shirts in your area.<br /><br />This Raptor issue also troubles our MIPS port. Currently we have three members and of this only the lead role can be performed by someone else. We have a nice group of people around us, but we are always searching for new members. If you want to help with documenting or other activities, just get in touch. No, you don't need to be Chinese :-P. If you have a Yeeloong netbook and got tired or Mandriva, help us test and build third-party packages.<br /><br />We would really like to know about Open Source activities happening all over China or maybe you have suggestions. If you want to discuss this with us, join <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#fedora-zh">#fedora-zh</a> and <a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/chinese">mailinglist</a>. Mel's agenda for this week <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2010/07/30/help-me-figure-out-my-time-in-china/">is still open</a>, so if you want to meet her in Shanghai, this is your chance.<br /><br />Thanks to all the members of the Chinese Fedora Community!</div>
