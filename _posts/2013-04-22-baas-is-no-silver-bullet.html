<p>After attending Barcamp北京, and seeing a talk by a friend of mine, I though to write a little as feedback. He showed how to create a small application in mere minutes using <abbr title="Backend as a Service">BaaS</abbr>. Of course it was purely show as most of the needed code came from snippets and additional libraries, but his point was 'you do not need a CTO'. Let me explain and where I agree and disagree, as I have been saying the same often to startups.</p>

<p>When a group of people have an idea, and take the plunge of creating a product, doing the company registration, etc They often leapfrog ahead by wanting to hire a CTO to assist them with the technological choices. Often they are not at that point yet as the idea has not materialized as a working prototype. Sometimes they expect to have everything ready, on a UI and UX-level for their <abbr title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</abbr>. This is quite unrealistic as the aim of the MVP should be to get User Feedback and see if your product/idea has the effect you expected. In an early stage you scrap most of your code and rewrite it. Overdesigning at this stage should be avoided.</p>

<p>This is where a BaaS comes in. Backed as a Service is one of those buzzwords being thrown when it comes to cloud computing. It is higher defined than a <abbr title="Platform as a Service">PaaS</abbr>, eg. Heroku which provides you with a choice of programming language and database engines to use. A BaaS differs in the sense that they provide you with a backend solution, they choose a database engine and can often deal with your user management etc. Often the only thing you need to bother about is the APIl ibrary to include in your application and defining some simple domain object definitions. The BaaS takes care of user login, persistency, etc. There are several providers available, of which Parse.com is the most well-known. As I will explain, this is ideal for a small startup to built their MVP on as you mostly only need a simple domain expert (someone who understand the product or idea you have and how to visualize the components) who knows a little of the API these BaaS providers have and of course the client coding. No backend configuration skills are needed, no knowledge of Linux or the database engine. However, a BaaS also has their disadvantages.</p>

<p>First of all, most of these services are offered using a freemium model. The entry is therefore quite risk-free in both cost and fitness. As an example, the most well-known of these prviders grants you a million API calls and enough storage to build your MVP. You can experime and create different solutions without having to bother about the backend or inserting new table when using a traditional database, etc. This freemium model also has it's price and this becomes aware when you have reached a certain point and have a scale. Secondly, these services are most often hosted America. This is not a problem to most of the time when dealing with an MVP, but when you have users in different geographical locations you might have to think of this. Especially in China and some other places in the APAC, where I currently reside, this is a serious problem, but this deserves to be discussed in a separate article. So with flexibility you also gave up control. This boils down to a lot of situations that a CT, DevOps or SySops cares about. All of sudden you can not move your data around, place it more close to the user, or even back-up the data using your own solutions. When the service provider decides on a maintenance window, you have to comply. You might even base your design too much on their API that a redesign is not just justified, but probably needed.</p>

<p>Using a BaaS is certainly a good start and allows you to focus on the product. You'd rather need consulting at this stage and when you are ready, you can look for this CTO rockstar. But be aware, you are postponing the inevitable. WHen you have reached scale, you will notice the cost involved with a BaaS is not always the cheapest option and can impose some serious challenges when it comes to scalability. There are solutions out there which have attracted my attentions. One of them is <a href="http://www.baasbox.com/" title="BaasBox - Open Source backend as a service">BaasBox</a>. It is currently under active development and a hosted solution is not yet available, but the offering is Open Source. Which means that the sources of their implementation are provided and can be worked on by others. It uses Java on their backend so it can easily be deployed in almost any Amazon instance, or OpenShift container. It allows you to deploy the whole solution on your own servers and best of all even your desktop during development. In future articles I will explore other solutions, but also explain how this can fits into o a full-stack solution with a mobile and HTML5 client and performance suggestions when running on one of the cloud computing solutions.</p>
