Just built and packaged the libvirt library version 0.6.0 for use with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and CentOS 5 (or any other EL5 compatible system). This library supports the following virtualization systems: Xen, KVM, Qemu and OpenVZ.<br /><br />Files are located at <a href="http://files.gbraad.nl/packages/el5/">http://files.gbraad.nl/packages/el5/</a>.<br /><br />These packages have been signed with my packaging key, which is available <a href="http://files.gbraad.nl/packages/RPM-GPG-KEY-gbraad.asc">here</a> (<a href="http://gbraad.fedorapeople.org/RPM-GPG-KEY-gbraad.asc">mirror</a>). More information about this library can be found on the <a href="http://libvirt.org/">libvirt</a> homepage.</div>
