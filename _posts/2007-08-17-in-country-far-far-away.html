<div class='post'>
On the 26th of August I will go to China again. There are a lot of things I will do; family, business, travel and spotting nice stuff. Probably some of them I will post on <a href="http://www.geekfm.com/">GeekFM</a>. I have been invited by <a href="http://www.verdoold.com/">Wilco</a> to participate by posting on the blog. A job I am happy to do :oD. I will return on the 4th of October with Shan on my right hand and hopefully a business license in my left.</div>
