<div class='post'>
Someday I had to write about it... especially because I lost all of the sources of the publishing engine. Just a few of the things remain; a <a href="http://gbraad.nl/photos/spotlight/server.jpg">server</a> with broken harddiscs and a <a href="http://spotsnel.nl/">domain name</a> which I bought back. <a href="http://gbraad.nl/site/?p=spotlight">SpotlightMedia</a> was interesting... just too bad I resigned and the product SpotSnel failed. The company itself disappeared, just like their websites. Just the idea remains...</div>
