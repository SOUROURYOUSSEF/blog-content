Some of my fellow workers called me 'dotnettende maccer' or 'maccerende dotnetter'... the last means in Dutch something similar to 'complaining dotnet developer'. The reason why? Well, I was not satisfied with the HP notebook that was ordered for me... it was a little too big and heavy. Eventually I got replaced with the MacBook I had wanted. Call me a 'geek with attitude'.<br /><br />To prove them right about the second meaning, I would show them .NET development in the more traditional way is possible. In the screenshot below you can see Visual Studio running on Mac OS X. This is done using VMware's Fusion beta 4 using Unity mode, a BootCamp partition with Windows XP Pro SP2 and of course the Intel MacBook itself running Mac OS X 10.4.9.<br /><br /><img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/gbraad/RmvUc8pZGII/AAAAAAAAAbY/pea3xEacyXY/s400/VisualStudioOnMac.jpg" alt="Visual Studio on Mac OS X using VMware Fusion's Unity mode" /><br /><br />The new Unity mode of VMware Fusion is similar to Parallel Desktop's coherence mode. It allows VMware to run in the background and still show the application you want in the OS X environment; that is without the taskbar. This functionality is similar to Parallel, but I prefer to use VMware... since all the virtual machines I run are based on VMware as you can see below.<br /><br /><img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/gbraad/Rfs9vbgjBfI/AAAAAAAAANg/9HENnjunwtU/s400/VMware.jpg" alt="VMware Server on two Linux servers and VMware Workstation 6 on Windows Vista" /><br /><br />This screenshot was taken on Vista running VMware Workstation 6 and connected to two Linux servers running VMware Server.<br /><br />Of course I also installed Mono on OS X. Probably soon I will show some application running on OS X which are .NET applications. Since recently Paint.NET became available as being able to run on Mono (<a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2007/May-15-1.html">blog post</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/paint-mono/">project page</a>).</div>
