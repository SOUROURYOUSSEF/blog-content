At the moment I use a VMware virtual machine for .NET development on the Mac. It is a openSuSE 10.2 installation as originally provided by the <a href="http://mono-project.com/">mono project</a>. The mono installation is a new compilation from the Olive development branch. As the editor I do use MonoDevelop... although I could have sticked with emacs. At the moment I think the support for .NET on Mac OS X is quite meager. You need to use fink (or macports/darwinports) to recompile GTK and a lot more essentials to get <a href="http://monodevelop.org/">MonoDevelop</a> running. It is a Gnome application?! And same argument here, I could have sticked with emacs... but general development towards fellow workers is easier if done in an IDE. Below is a screenshot of an <a href="http://www.sogyo.nl/dddrobot">unmodified project</a> from work in MonoDevelop. Most parts compile without any difficulty, while some might still need some minor adjustments.<br /><br /><img src="http://lh5.google.com/gbraad/Rqzd5aqj5XI/AAAAAAAAAiA/NDWyxKTbqvw/s400/monodevelop.jpg" style="border: 0pt none;" /><br /><br />It shows how mature Linux is for .NET development. In some places I even think it is a little ahead of the rest. The Silverlight implementation on Linux, called <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Moonlight">Moonlight</a>, already can run desklets. These are small widgets for the desktop. The code can be found in the Olive trunk. Normally I would have used fedora or ubuntu as my main distro, but <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mono-olive/browse_thread/thread/a5f4c0e0c2a1411d">I got it working</a> :-D. It opens a lot of opportunities for new applications I was not able to make on the Windows platform. There are a lot of application on Gnome which are mono applications. These are Banshee, Tomboy, gtwitter, Landell and a lot more. I would also like to see our internal application for profile editing to be ported to Un*x/Linux... and have it included in <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Companies_Using_Mono">this list</a>.<br /><br />A very good example of a true crossplatform utility is <a href="http://www.snorp.net/log/tangerine">Tangerine</a>. It is a DAAP server written in Mono which utilizes Avahi to respond to mDNS (or Bonjour) requests. It works on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. I use it daily for distributing music between my vm's who can not use the shared folders.<br /><br />At the moment I am investigating the usage of D-Bus and a similar idea as mopen.exe to connect services to an active domain. Details will follow...</div>
