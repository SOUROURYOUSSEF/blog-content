Recently I built and packaged the 1.0.4 release of FreeSWITCH for CentOS 5.3 as i386 and x86_64. They are hosted on a temporary location <a href="http://vps01.spotsnel.net/freeswitch/">http://files.spotsnel.net/freeswitch/</a>. Eventually they will move to a repository for use with <span style="font-style:italic;">yum</span>.</div>
