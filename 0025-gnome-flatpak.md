In this presentation I will introduce Flatpak and how it changes the software
distribution model for Linux. In short it will explain the negatives of using
packages, how Flatpak solves this, and how to create your own applications and
distribute them for use with Flatpak. This presentation was given at the [GNOME
3.22 release party](//www.bjgug.org/events/gnome-3-22-party/), organized by the
Beijing GNOME User Group.
