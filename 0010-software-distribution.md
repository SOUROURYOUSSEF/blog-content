In this presentation I will introduce Software Distribution for a new era. In
short it will explain the negatives of using packages, how 'containers' improved
on this, but now how to make this available for use on servers and desktops. 

In short it will talk about the following topics:

  * container and Docker
  * FlatPak
  * OSTree
  * Project Atomic (Fedora, CentOS)
