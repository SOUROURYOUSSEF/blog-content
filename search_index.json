With the advent of Docker, IT has underwent a dramatic change. For instance, it became easy to setup throw-away development environments. These could then be used to create clean environments to perform builds in. And eventually, containers are starting to move into the general infrastructure . This is a transaction that is currently still happening, helped by tools as Docker Swarm and Kubernetes. In this short article I will show how these ideas can help in setting up a composable infrastructure, providing you with a powerful IDE in the cloud, full with Let's Encrypt certificate generation.Cloud9We will be deploying C9, or Cloud9 IDE, is a full IDE which can be accessed from your browser. For convenience of use, I created a containerized version of this some while back and have ever since been using it. Although,, C9 also has a hosted environment, I grew worried after Amazon acquired the company. Support has since been slower to respond and this made me look into other ways to provide an alternative approach. After some testing with Docker Cloud it seemed like a good idea to deploy a self-hosted alternative.But first about one of the main components. The container I created exposes port 8181, which is an unsecured endpoint. It allows you to simply setup a local instance with:$ alias c9ide='docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/workspace gbraad/c9ide:u1604'\n$ cd ~/Projects/gauth\n$ c9ide\nThis would however work for a local environment and does not provide a secure solution. More was needed... such as secure solution and preferably automated. For this Nginx and Let's Encrypt is used.  More information about Cloud9 can be found in my Knowledge Base article*.PreparationTo deploy the environment I used Fedora 24. Most cloud providers provide this as an image. In my case, CityCloud provided the latest version after placing a simple request. You can consider any size, but the more storage and memory, the better the performance will be. I set up a 4G and 2 cores instance, with 50G of storage. After logging in, perform the following commands$ sudo su -\n$ dnf update -y\n$ dnf install -y docker\n$ setenforce 0\n$ sed 's/SELINUX=targeted/SELINUX=permisssive/g' /etc/selinux/config\n$ systemctl enable docker\n$ systemctl start docker\nNote: SELinux is disabled because we will have a volume attached to the IDE container where the workspace will be located. We can however fix this, but this is something for a future blog post.Setup DNSAfter this, you host machine should be ready to host containers to will make up our environment. before we continue, we need to be sure we have DNS configured that can point to the running containers that host the C9 IDE. I used CloudFlare and setup the following wildcard for my environment.With this each hostname, such as ubuntu.c9ide.spotsnel.net would point to the same machine that hosts our development containers.Deploy NginxTo allow a hostname to be resolved to a 'local' end-point a reverse proxy is needed. Jason Wilder created a container for this purpose called nginx-proxy. It needs access to the docker.sock to be notified of changes and it will accordingly create an endpoint in the hosted Nginx. For more information about this, please read nginx-proxy's description on Docker hub.# docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \\\n   --name nginx-proxy \\\n   -v /path/to/certs:/etc/nginx/certs:ro \\\n   -v /etc/nginx/vhost.d \\\n   -v /usr/share/nginx/html \\\n   -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro \\\n   jwilder/nginx-proxy\nOpening any address pointing to this host would know result in a 503 error. This means that Nginx is listening and can not forward the request. We will deal with this later.Deploy Let's Encrypt companionSetting up a secure connection involves certificates which can be quite a hassle to obtain, and if trust of security is concerned, even very expensive. Luckily, initiatives exist that believe security should be available to all and Let's Encrypt provides a fully automated solution. Using the letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion container created by Yves Blusseau, it is possible allow the proxy container to be provisioned with the needed certificates. More information about this container can be found at Docker hub.# docker run -d \\\n   --name nginx-proxy-letsencrypt \\\n   -v /path/to/certs:/etc/nginx/certs:rw \\\n   --volumes-from nginx-proxy \\\n   -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \\\n   jrcs/letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion\nUnfortunately we do not have a way to really test this. But if the container starts correctly and does not terminate, it is likely working correctly, waiting for notifications of newly created containers.ExplanationContainers that provide metadata in the form of environment variables, indicate to these service containers what the endpoint will be.The nginx-proxy service uses VIRTUAL_HOST to know what the hostname endpoint will be. While the Let's Encrypt companion service uses LETSENCRYPT_HOST for this. In the rest of this article the endpoints will be the same. With LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL we indicate to who the certificate will be addressed.C9 IDEThe container hosting C9 is available in different flavors. I have created them based on CentOS 7, Fedora 24 and Ubuntu Xenail (16.04). To prepare, it is a good idea to pull the images locally:# docker pull gbraad/c9ide:c7\n# docker pull gbraad/c9ide:f24\n# docker pull gbraad/c9ide:u1604\nTo setup the containers as endpoints, I created the following helper script. It will deal with setting up the host and email for login to the container../create.sh [name] [host] [email] [password] [flavor] [volume]#!/bin/sh -x\nset -e\n\nNAME=${1:-\"test\"}\nHOST=${2:-${NAME}\".local\"}\nUSER=${3:-\"nobody@local\"}\nPASS=${4:-\"secrete\"}\nFLAVOR=${5:-\"u1604\"}  # c7, f24, u1604\nVOLUME=${6:-\"/workspaces/c9ide-\"${NAME}}\n\nmkdir -p ${VOLUME}\ndocker run -d \\\n   --name ${NAME} \\\n   -v ${VOLUME}:/workspace:rw \\\n   -e \"VIRTUAL_HOST=${HOST}\" \\\n   -e \"LETSENCRYPT_HOST=${HOST}\" \\\n   -e \"LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=${USER}\" \\\n   -e \"USERNAME=${USER}\" \\\n   -e \"PASSWORD=${PASS}\" \\\n   gbraad/c9ide:${FLAVOR}\nThe USERNAME and PASSWORD are used to perform basic authentication.  As you can see, the email address used for the certificates is also used for the username for login. This can of course customized.\n After this,# chmod +x create.sh\n# mkdir /workspaces\n# ./create.sh ubuntu ubuntu.c9ide.spotsnel.net me@gbraad.nl verysecrete\n# ./create.sh centos quentin.c9ide.spotsnel.net me@quentinyong.nl verysecrete c7\nwill create two containers, hosted at ubuntu.c9ide.spotsnel.net and quentin.c9ide.spotsnel.net. Notice that I used /workspaces to provide the storage location for all the host containers. Make sure this is hosted on a separate mountpoint for instance.Now open your IDE by opening https://ubuntu.c9ide.spotsnel.net in your browser. If all goes well, you will be created by a login prompt. The username is me@gbraad.nl and the password verysecrete.In future articles I will detail more about the composability of infrastructure. if you enjoyed this article, consider tweeting about it. If you have comments, please find me online at @gbraad."},"0005-custom-ceph-atomic-deployment.html":{"url":"0005-custom-ceph-atomic-deployment.html","title":"Deployment of Ceph using custom Atomic images","keywords":"","body":"As part of providing a scalable infrastructure, many components in the datacenter are now moving towards software-based solutions, such as SDN (for networking) and SDS (for storage). Ceph one of these projects to provide a scalable, software-based software solution. It is often used in conjuction with OpenStack for storing disk images and block access for volumes. Setting up an environment usually involves installing a base operating system and configuring the machine to join a storage cluster. In this article I will setup a Atomic based image that allows for fast deployment of Ceph cluster. This is not a recommended solution, but an exercise that shows how to cutomize Atomic Host and using Ansible to standup a Ceph cluster.ComponentsAtomic* Host is a new generation of Operating Systems that used to create an immutable infrastructure to deploy and scale containerized applications. For this, it uses a technology called OSTree* which is a git-like model for dealing with filesystem trees. It allows different filesystems to exist alongside of each other. If a filesystem is not booting properly, it is possible to move back to the previous state.Ceph* is a distributed storage solution which provides Object Storage, Block Storage and FIlesystem access. Ceph comes with several software components which provides a role in the cluster, such as a monitor or storage daemon.Ansible* is a configuration and system management tool which for example can do multi-node deployment of software or execution of commandsAlthough Atomic Hosts are primarily used to deploy Docker and Kubernetes environments, or even containerized versions of the Ceph daemons, I will show how it is possible to use ostree to deploy the Ceph software on nodes, with minimal effort. Ansible is used to send commands to these nodes and finalize the configuration.PreparationFor this setup we will use about 7 machines. To simplify testing, I have performed these actions on an OpenStack environment, such as DreamCompute.1 controller and compose node, running Fedora 24 with IP address 10.3.0.2\n\n3 Ceph monitors, running CentOS Atomic with IP addresses 10.3.0.3-5\n\n3 Ceph storage nodes, running CentOS Atomic with IP addresses 10.3.0.6-8 and attached storage volume at /dev/vdb.\n\nTo deploy you can start with setting up the Fedora node.Install controllerTo deploy our environment we setup a controller node which can access the other nodes in the network using SSH. In our case we will use Fedora 24.  After installing the operating system, perform the following commands:$ dnf update -y\n$ dnf install -y  ansible rpm-ostree git python\n$ ssh-keygen\n$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\nThe last two commands generate an SSH authentication key and will show the result on the command line.Atomic nodesThe installation media for Atomic can be found at the main project page. It comes in two different distribution types, CentOS or Fedora. For this article I used CentOS, and downloaded it from the following location:$ wget http://http://cloud.centos.org/centos/7/atomic/images/CentOS-Atomic-Host-7-GenericCloud.qcow2\nand uploaded it to my OpenStack environment with:$ openstack image create \"CentOS7 Atomic\" --progress --file CentOS-Atomic-Host-7-GenericCloud.qcow2 --disk-format qcow2 --container-format bare --property os_distro=centos\nAfter this, I created six identical machines, with provisioning a predefined SSH key with cloud-init which we made on the controller node. If you are not using OpenStack, you have to use a cloud-init configdrive to configure the node with the SSH key. This process is described here.The storage nodes need to have to configured with a dedicated volume for use with the osd storage daemon of Ceph. By creating a volume and attaching them to the node, these will be identified as /dev/vdb. There is no need to prepapre a filesystem on them. This will be handles by the deployment scripts.Note: if you want to upload disk images to DreamCompute or other Ceph-backed OpenStack image services, you have to convert the disk image to raw format first. An example of this can be found in an example for use of the OpenStack client.Compose treeOn the controller node we will create an ostree that will be used to setup the Ceph software on the Atomic host nodes. This process involves creating a definition for a filesystem tree that uses the base defintion of CentOS Atomic with the additional packages from the CentOS-specific Ceph packages.Atomic definitionWe will clone the git repositiory containing the base definition:$ mkdir -p /workspace\n$ cd /workspace\n$ git clone https://github.com/CentOS/sig-atomic-buildscripts.git \\\n    -b downstream \\\n    --depth 1 \\\n    ceph-atomic\nInside this folder you can add a RPM repository file where the Ceph packages are located:ceph-atomic/centos-ceph-jewel.repo[centos-ceph-jewel]\nname=CentOS-7 - Ceph Jewel\nbaseurl=http://buildlogs.centos.org/centos/7/storage/x86_64/ceph-jewel/\ngpgcheck=0\nAnd then we will define an Atomic host for Ceph-Jewel and specify which additional repositories and packages are used:ceph-atomic/ceph-atomic-host.json{\n    \"include\": \"centos-atomic-host.json\",\n    \"ref\": \"centos-atomic-host/7/x86_64/ceph-jewel\",\n    \"automatic_version_prefix\": \"2016.0\",\n    \"repos\": [\"centos-ceph-jewel\", \"epel\"],\n    \"packages\": [\n        \"ceph\",\n        \"ntp\",\n        \"ntpdate\",\n        \"hdparm\",\n        \"autogen-libopts\"\n    ]\n}\nNote: with include we base our image off an existing definition. In our case this will simplify the process, but it also means we will end up with an image with unneeded components. For our test this is not an issue.After this, the defintion for the Ceph-specific Atomic host is finished. Before we can compose the ostree, we have to create and initialize the repository directory:$ mkdir -p /srv/repo\n$ ostree --repo=/srv/repo init --mode=archive-z2\nWhen you perform the following command:$ rpm-ostree compose tree \\\n    --repo=/srv/repo \\\n    ./ceph-atomic/ceph-atomic-host.json\npackages will be fetched and committed to an ostree in /srv/repo. After this, you will have a filesystem tree which can be served from a webserver, to be used by Atomic hosts.$ cd /srv/repo\n$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer\nThis will serve the content from /srv/repo on the endpoint http://10.3.0.2:8000/.DeploymentTo get the Atomic hosts to use the tree, the following commands will have to be used to provision the Ceph-based filesystem tree:$ sudo su -\n$ setenforce 0\n$ ostree remote add --set=gpg-verify=false atomic-ceph http://10.3.0.2:8000/\n$ rpm-ostree rebase atomic-ceph:centos-atomic-host/7/x86_64/ceph-jewel\n$ systemctl reboot\nThis is however very cumbersome as we have to do this on six nodes. To optimize this process, we will use Ansible.Note: setenforce 0 is used to prevent issue with SELinux label during the rebase action.OSTree provisioning using AnsibleCreate a file called hosts in your home directory with the following content:~/hosts[mons]\natomic-01 ansible_ssh_host=10.3.0.3\natomic-02 ansible_ssh_host=10.3.0.4\natomic-03 ansible_ssh_host=10.3.0.5\n\n[osds]\natomic-04 ansible_ssh_host=10.3.0.6\natomic-05 ansible_ssh_host=10.3.0.7\natomic-06 ansible_ssh_host=10.3.0.8\nTo test if the nodes are reachable, use the following command:$ ansible -i hosts all -u centos -s -m ping\nIf no error occurs, you are all set.Using Ansible and the hosts file we can perform these commands on all the nodes.$ ansible -i hosts all -u centos -s -m shell -a \"setenforce 0\"\n$ ansible -i hosts all -u centos -s -m shell -a \"ostree remote add --set=gpg-verify=false atomic-ceph http://10.3.0.2:8000/\"\n$ ansible -i hosts all -u centos -s -m shell -a \"rpm-ostree rebase atomic-ceph:centos-atomic-host/7/x86_64/ceph-jewel\"\n$ ansible -i hosts all -u centos -s -m shell -a \"systemctl disable docker\"\n$ ansible -i hosts all -u centos -s -m shell -a \"systemctl reboot\"\nThe last command will throw errors, but this is expected as the connection to the node is dropped. To check if the nodes are up again, you can perform the previous ping test again.Note: since we based on the original CentOS Atomic host image, it will have Docker installed. For this article we do not use it, so it is best to disable it.Deployment using ceph-ansibleIf the previous step succeeded you would have six atomic hosts that are ready to be configured to form a small Ceph cluster; 3 nodes will serve the role of monitor, while the other nodes will be storage nodes with an attached volume at /dev/vdb. For the deployment we will use ceph-ansible. This is a collection of playbooks to help with common scenarios for a Ceph storage cluster.From your home folder perform the following command:$ git clone https://github.com/ceph/ceph-ansible.git --depth 1\nThis will clone the latest version of the playbooks. But before we can use them, we will need to configure it for our setup. But before we do, we initialize it with the base configuration. Take note that we will re-use our previosuly used ~/hosts file for Ansible.$ cd ceph-ansible\n$ cp site.yml.sample site.yml\n$ cp group_vars/all.sample group_vars/all\n$ cp group_vars/mons.sample group_vars/mons\n$ cp group_vars/osds.sample group_vars/osds\n$ ln -s ~/hosts hosts\nWe will now customize the configuration by changing the following files and add the shows content to the top of the file:group_vars/allcluster_network: 10.3.0.0/24\ngenerate_fsid: 'true'\nceph_origin: distro\nmonitor_interface: eth0\npublic_network: 10.3.0.0/24\njournal_size: 5120\ngroup_vars/mons\ncephx: false\ngroup_vars/monscephx: false\ngroup_vars/osdsjournal_collocation: true\ncephx: false\ndevices:\n   - /dev/vdb\nAfter these changes are made, you have setup to use Ceph packages as provided by the distribution, and to deploy as a storage cluster on 10.3.0.0/24.To deploy the storage cluster, all we need to do now is to run the playbook named site.yml and skipping the tags named with_pkg and package-install.$ ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml --skip-tags with_pkg,package-install\nAfter this finishes a storage cluster should be available.ConclusionThis article showed how it is possible to customize an Atomic host image for a specific use-case and use this for deployment of a simple Ceph cluster. Using ostree it is possible to move between different trees, allowing a collection of packages to be upgraded in an atomic fashion. And when there is a failure for some reason, it is possible to rollback to the previous tree and allow the node to function in the former state.This is part of the setup I usefor automated builds of Ceph packages and deployment tests.

This is not only a bad security practice for running internet facing services, it might even prevent certain applications from working properly. So, how do you run commands as a non-root user? For people using Red Hat-based systems, such as Fedora or CentOS I will explain how you can do this.Let's beginLet's say you have a Dockerfile using Fedora as a base:FROM fedora:24\nCreate userBefore we can use a different user, we need to create one:RUN adduser user\nRun as userNow you can run commands as this user by doing:RUN su - user -c \"touch me\"\nThe container start process can be changed to:CMD [\"su\", \"-\", \"user\", \"-c\", \"/bin/bash\"]\nThis way, a bash shell will open as the user.Allow sudo usageSince you are running a normal user, it might be handy to install the following package inside the container:RUN dnf install -y sudo\nThis will allow you to use sudo to perform actions as the root user:RUN echo \"user ALL=(root) NOPASSWD:ALL\" > /etc/sudoers.d/user && \\\n    chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/user\nFinal DockerfileTo combine all of this, your Dockerfile would look as follows:DockerfileFROM fedora:24\n\nRUN dnf install -y sudo && \\\n    adduser user && \\\n    echo \"user ALL=(root) NOPASSWD:ALL\" > /etc/sudoers.d/user && \\\n    chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/user\n\nRUN su - user -c \"touch mine\"\n\nCMD [\"su\", \"-\", \"user\", \"-c\", \"/bin/bash\"]\nResultBuilding this container is simple:$ docker build -t user .\nStep 1 : FROM fedora:24\n ---> f9873d530588\nStep 2 : RUN dnf install -y sudo &&     adduser user &&     echo \"user ALL=(root) NOPASSWD:ALL\" > /etc/sudoers.d/user &&     chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/user\n ---> Using cache\n ---> 05c3f3c7e9fc\nStep 3 : RUN su - user -c \"touch me\"\n ---> Running in 584ab0ad025b\n ---> 66ea558b9855\nRemoving intermediate container 584ab0ad025b\nStep 4 : CMD su - user -c /bin/bash\n ---> Running in 780e0ccd5f61\n ---> b19a10012b28\nRemoving intermediate container 780e0ccd5f61\nSuccessfully built b19a10012b28\nRunning it will produce the following result:$ docker run -it --rm user\n[user@48add6313ab6 ~]$ ls -al\ntotal 20\ndrwx------ 2 user user 4096 Sep  8 08:51 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Sep  8 08:46 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 4 user user   18 May 17 14:22 .bash_logout\n-rw-r--r-- 4 user user  193 May 17 14:22 .bash_profile\n-rw-r--r-- 4 user user  231 May 17 14:22 .bashrc\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user    0 Sep  8 08:51 me\n[user@48add6313ab6 ~]$ pwd\n/home/user\n[user@48add6313ab6 ~]$ \nBase imagesIf you are setting up base images for re-use, it can be handy to use the USER keyword. This will run all the following commqnds as a particalur. Lets say, you want to use a service, which is Node.JS based, you can create the following DockerfileFROM centos:7\nMAINTAINER Gerard Braad \n\n# Run update and install dependencies\nRUN yum update -y && yum install -y nodejs npm\n\n# Add the user UID:1000, GID:1000, home at /app\nRUN groupadd -r app -g 1000 && useradd -u 1000 -r -g app -m -d /app -s /sbin/nologin -c \"App user\" app && \\\n    chmod 755 /app\n\n# Set the working directory to app home directory\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Specify the user to execute all commands below\nUSER app\nYou can then use this container as a base for NodeJS based applications. You copy the application to /app and when commands are run, they will use the user named user.I hope this has been of some help to you.

Nothing is truer than this statement. This means that when writing code it is important to have a good idea of what you are doing. Write clean code, which is simple or easy to reason about. Since if you can't explain it, how could others even understand it well. Syntax highlighting of code can help. With this, certain keywords or structure get emphasized by using a color. I do not think it is an ideal solution, but subconsciously it seems I focus more on the code. Likely, the colors themselves are pleasing to look at.Pleasant to the eyesPerhaps because of this last, I tend to always implement or set the Tomorrow Theme for my color scheme, and specifically the Night Bright variant. Below you can find an example, as I also enabled it on my blog by implementing a Pygments style.Exampleserver.js'use strict';\n\n// get port from environment settings for deployment on Heroku\nvar EXPRESS_PORT = process.env.OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_PORT || process.env.PORT || 4000;\nvar EXPRESS_IPADDR = process.env.OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_IP || process.env.IPADDR || '127.0.0.1';\nvar EXPRESS_ROOT = __dirname;\n\nfunction startExpress(root, port, ipaddr) {\n  var express = require('express');\n  var app = express();\n  app.use(express.static(root));\n  app.listen(port, ipaddr, function() {\n    console.log('Listening on %s:%d',\n        ipaddr, port);\n  });\n}\n\nstartExpress(EXPRESS_ROOT, EXPRESS_PORT, EXPRESS_IPADDR);\nImplementationsChris Kempson now has a new color scheme called 'base16`and it has a 'Tomorrow' variant. It must be the name as I always install 'Tomorrow' first. Here are some of the Night Bright variants I have made over the years:Pygments\n\nChrome DevTools\n\nBrackets\n\nCodeMirror\n\n...\n\nHow about languageSince my wife and I are very involved in teaching, I have also experimented with the idea of using word or word-class highlighting for English. The results are that it can actually help. Words that need to be stressed, or emphasized, can be highlighted in a different color. Think of words like 'very', 'never', etc. Some of this can be automated, as can be seen in the following examples:NLP-compromise, Text Parsing\n\nEnglish-text-highlighting\n\nEnglish syntax highlighter\n\nKnwl.js\n\nThese implementations range from simple hard-coded word matching, to actual Natural Language Processing.ExampleTake for instance the following example of Alice In Wonderland - Down the Rabbit Hole.\"There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\"When adverb, verb, conjunction, etc. are highlighted, the text will look as follows:Note: this is taken from English syntax highlighter. Try and see for yourself if it can help.ChineseHighlighting does not only work well for English. Chinese for instance is a tonal language. Which means that a pronounciation of a character can have a different tone for a different meaning. When not proprerly mastered, this can lead to a lot of confusion or embarrassment. For learner's of Chinese it is actually common to highlight the tones. An example of this is shown here:welcome\n\nv.t.\n欢迎 huānyíng;  迎接 yíngjiē\n\nWelcome home again!\n\n欢迎你又回家了!\n\nHuānyíng nǐ yòu huíjiā le!\nConclusionHighlighting can serve different purposes. I can not recall that highlighting actually helped me to write clean or correct code, or that it even prevented me from making a mistake or typo. However, it can certainly provide a plesant feeling, in which you can 'feel good' about your code in another way. For languages, such as English and Chinese, it can assist with the learning process."},"0008-multitier-setup-openstack.html":{"url":"0008-multitier-setup-openstack.html","title":"Building a multi-tier application using OpenStack (PackStack)","keywords":"","body":"This is a publication of an article/training class I gave related to setting up\nan environment using OpenStack, to host a multi-tier applicatiom.IntroductionIn this hands-on-labs you will learn how to set-up an OpenStack environment to\nhost a multi-tier application; front-end, back-end and the related network\nsettings to prevent access to back-end servers, etc.To setup the environment quickly, we will be using PackStack.

We will be setting up a\nsimple environment in which storage between two webservers needs to be replicated.GlusterFS is a scalable network filesystem suitable for data-intensive tasks. It\nis free and open source software and can utilize common off-the-shelf hardware.\nTo learn more, please see the Gluster project home page.PrerequisitesYou will need two servers available, each with a dedicated disk for storage,\nsuch as /dev/vdb or /dev/sdb. I will be using Fedora 24, which of writing\nis the latest version.The following needs to be installed on both servers:$ dnf install -y glusterfs-server xfsprogs\nThis includes the server component for the distributed filesystem, and the tools\nneeded to format the disk we will use to store the files. Gluster recommends to\nuse XFS as the filesystem.We will assume for this article, that the machines will be running Apache. If\nthis is not installed already, you can do the following:$ dnf install -y httpd\nHostnamesMake sure the hostnames and IP addresses of the servers are known to each other.\nFor this, check the content of /etc/hosts/etc/hosts37.153.173.244 server01-public\n37.153.173.245 server01-public\n10.3.0.44 server01-private\n10.3.0.45 server02-private\nNote: these servers have two interfaces, Although this is not necessary, it is\nstrongly recommended to separate the traffic from the web and what you use for\nthe storage network. In our case, the web-facing IP addresses have not been\nload-balanced yet. This is a topic for future articles.Prepare disksSince Gluster relies on extended file attributes (xattr), we will need to increase\nthe inode size when formatting the disks.Perform on the following on both the servers$ mkfs.xfs -i size=512 /dev/vdb\nmeta-data=/dev/vdb               isize=512    agcount=4, agsize=3276800 blks\n         =                       sectsz=512   attr=2, projid32bit=1\n         =                       crc=1        finobt=1, sparse=0\ndata     =                       bsize=4096   blocks=13107200, imaxpct=25\n         =                       sunit=0      swidth=0 blks\nnaming   =version 2              bsize=4096   ascii-ci=0 ftype=1\nlog      =internal log           bsize=4096   blocks=6400, version=2\n         =                       sectsz=512   sunit=0 blks, lazy-count=1\nrealtime =none                   extsz=4096   blocks=0, rtextents=0\nNow we need to create a mountpoint for the filesystem. We will use\n/data/var-www/brick01 on server01:$ mkdir -p /data/var-www/brick01\n$ echo '/dev/vdb /data/var-www/brick01 xfs defaults 1 2' >> /etc/fstab\n$ mount -a \nand /data/var-www/brick02 on server02:$ mkdir -p /data/var-www/brick02\n$ echo '/dev/vdb /data/var-www/brick02 xfs defaults 1 2' >> /etc/fstab\n$ mount -a \nSetup GlusterYou will now create a cluster of Gluster servers, which means that we will create\na trust between the two nodes. But before we can do this, we need to make sure\nthe Gluster daemon is running on the nodes. Perform the following commands on\nboth of the nodes:$ systemctl enable glusterd\n$ systemctl start glusterd\n$ systemctl status glusterd\nNow we need to create the trusted connection. The following commands will only\nneed to be used on one of the nodes. In my case, this will be server01:$ gluster peer probe server02-private\npeer probe: success.\nNote: the hostname here refers to the private IP address. This is not the same\nrange as the public network. For security purposes you will likely separate the\ntraffic.You can verify is the trust exists by running:$ gluster peer status\nNumber of Peers: 1\n\nHostname: server02-private\nUuid: af523e9b-4257-485d-aa45-ebd24f115c42\nState: Peer in Cluster (Connected)\nIf you would run this command also on server02, you would get a similar result:Number of Peers: 1\n\nHostname: server01-private\nUuid: 74c77082-b62c-4cc4-b33f-02de36083990\nState: Peer in Cluster (Connected)\nCreate Gluster volumeIn case of a failure, we do not want our data to be unavailable. Therefore we\nneed to have two copies of our data, and we do this by creating a replicated\nvolume.This command will only need to be run on one node, as Gluster will take care of\nthe related nodes.$ gluster volume create var-www replica 2 \\\n          server01-private:/data/var-www/brick01/volume \\\n          server02-private:/data/var-www/brick02/volume\nvolume create: var-www: success: please start the volume to access data\n$ gluster volume start var-www\nvolume start: var-www: success\n$ gluster volume info\nVolume Name: var-www\nType: Replicate\nVolume ID: e91014ca-f98c-42e5-8e75-de4d2e65f569\nStatus: Started\nNumber of Bricks: 1 x 2 = 2\nTransport-type: tcp\nBricks:\nBrick1: server01-private:/data/var-www/brick01/volume\nBrick2: server02-private:/data/var-www/brick02/volume\nOptions Reconfigured:\ntransport.address-family: inet\nperformance.readdir-ahead: on\nnfs.disable: on\nMount Gluster volumeBefore you can mount the volume on /var/www to share the webpages, we need to\nmove the original /var/www out of the way and create a new directory to mount.\nPerform the following commands on both the servers:$ systemctl stop httpd\n$ mv /var/www{,.orig}\n$ mkdir /var/www\nNow that we have the mountpoint, we can add an entry to fstab to deal with\nmounting of our volume. On server01 you need to do the following:$ echo 'server01-private:/var-www /var/www glusterfs defaults,_netdev,fetch-attempts=3 0 0' >> /etc/fstab\n$ mount -a\nAnd on server02:$ echo 'server02-private:/var-www /var/www glusterfs defaults,_netdev,fetch-attempts=3 0 0' >> /etc/fstab\n$ mount -a\nNow the volume has been mounted and replication is available. We use _netdev\nbecause network needs to be up before we can use this filesystem, and fetch_attempts\nwill deal with the volume information in case of a failure. Since we have multiple\nIP address, this is a suggested setting.Test replicationOn server01 you can do the following:$ mkdir -p /var/www/html\n$ echo 'Hello, World!' > /var/www/html/index.html\n$ systemctl start httpd\nIf you would now open the web facing IP address, you should see the message:\nHello, World!.Note: if you have issues opening the page, or the default Fedora test page gets\nreturned, you might have SELinux enabled. In this case, you need to turn on the\nfollowing boolean:$ setsebool -P httpd_use_fusefs 1\nwhich will allow Apache to use the FUSE filesystem mount as used by GlusterFS.Now, on server02 you can check the content of the folder:$ ls /var/www/html\nand you would see an index.html file. Now start Apache and you will see that\nthe content is also served from this server.$ systemctl start httpd\nConclusionUsing GlusterFS it is easy to setup an environment that can handle issues with\nstorage availability. You now have a replicate volume that is available on two\nservers. Actions we take on each of these servers, will be replicated to the\nother server.In this case we have setup the servers to handle both the storage and act as a\nclient to read these files. More advanced are available and are described in the\ndocumentation.Next stepNow that we have implemented replicated storage for our webservers, we need to\nprovide a HA solution to deal with the traffic on the webfacing IP addresses.\nIn an OpenStack environment you could use Neutron to setup a loadbalancer and \nhealth monitor for the two servers. How to set this up in described in the\nfollowing article.\nHowever, you can also do so with HAProxy and a failover mechanism, which will be\nthe topic of a future article.If you have questions please let me know on Twitter at @gbraad or by email."},"0013-document-generation.html":{"url":"0013-document-generation.html","title":"Document generation using Markdown and Pandoc","keywords":"","body":"Maintaining documentation can be an involved process,  especially when different versions and output formats are needed. One of the documents I, and probably you also, have to maintain is your work history or resume/CV. Some while back I changed this document from an OpenOffice document to plain text and ever since, this workflow has influenced how I deal with other documentation.Requirement and timelineIf I remember correctly the original version of my resume was written in Microsoft Word. As you can imagine, this limits the usage to Windows as the platform. Small corrections became unnecessarily difficult and painful. Of course I could use CrossOver Office or Wine and install Office 2003. But, this is never a long-term solution. So, I moved to OpenOffice as the .odt format looked promising. It was easy to use to generate the needed PDF output, but still... the workflow was far from ideal.I wanted a workflow in which I can use just plaintext, which could be converted into the final format. Text is easy to index and to story under version management. This lead me to using XML directly and the use of FO (Formatting Objects), and Apache FOP. This was painful, but the results were decent to even very acceptable. It allowed me to describe elements with metadata, such as 'suffix', 'employment-type', etc. And all could be validated and transformed using XSLT. Although the conclusion was that the workflow was slow as there was no preview and transforming just took long. Also, describing elements was not useful as no-one would use the source material directly. Most recruiter use analysis tools that rely on extracting keywords and generate  a profile based on this information. This can lead to incorrect results, but since they analyse hundreds of resumes this seems one of the best methods, besides being introduced by a reference.I moved to a simpler approach which allows me to change the document and have a partial, and acceptable  preview. By this time Markdown got more popular and I tried to convert my resume and it seemed like an acceptable approach. Using a standard parser the documents looked OK, but it missed the oomph. Then pandoc arrived and it changed everything.MarkdownUsing Markdown I would be able to write the following# _**Gerard Braad**_\n\n\n## Personal information\n\n  * Chinese name\n    : 吉拉德\n  * Date of Birth\n    : 22 February, 1981\n  * Nationality\n    : Dutch\n  * Email\n    : [me@gbraad.nl][personal email]\nIt will get rendered as follows:This source is humanly readable, and can be parsed by something like the Webinterface of GitHub into a decent representation. And when using Markdown Preview for Sublime Text, even editing this became a pleasure.PandocNow for introducing Pandoc. This tool is like a Swiss knife for handling documents. It can convert between different formats and allows you to specify a template for specific formats, such as HTML. This tool allows me to use:$ pandoc -o resume.html resume.md\nThis will generate a standard HTML output from resume.md as input. Headings are converted to h6, h5, etc. and links become a, etc.Styling and layoutBut the beauty shows when a template is used:$ pandoc --template resume-template.html -o resume.html resume.md\nThis will generate a similar output, however the template refers to a stylesheet to style the look of the output. Using a template and stylesheet I am able to format the document to my liking. And since the output of markdown auto-generates names for elements in a consistent way, it is easy to style and format the document.Take for instance the photo. Although I personally do not like photos on a resume, it is often requested. Placing it inline with the text does not look very nice.Using CSS it is possible to convert the following:# _**Gerard Braad**_\n\n\n## Personal information\n\n![Photo][personal photo]\n\n  * Chinese name\n    : 吉拉德\nWith the styling:figure {\n  float: right;\n  margin: 5px;\n  border: 1px solid #eee;\n}\nThe output of this will look as follows:Containerizing pandoc (software distribution)Pandoc itself is written in Haskell. Although a nice language, it has a different style of programming. This means that few people can contribute, and a distribution like Fedora or Ubuntu can not always provide the latest version. This can be due to possible dependency issues, but also the effort a packager has to put into it. The developer of this tool only provides a .deb package. Since I mostly work on Fedora and CentOS, I had to find an alternative solution to install this tool.This is a great use-case for a container, as it consolidates the dependencies of the tool, and will allow me to use the tool as packaged by the developer, on a distribution that would else not be supported. Because I use the provided package I can also file issues against a known version, which can aid in reproducibility.This lead to me creating a container called docugen. It uses pandoc, jekyll and pandoc-ruby to integrate Jekyll with pandoc.By setting an alias I can call pandoc as it is a local command, which actually calls the container:$ alias pandoc='docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/workspace gbraad/docugen pandoc'\n$ pandoc -o resume.html resume.md\nYou can find more information about it here.Automated generationSince creating the containerized version of Pandoc, it was easy to setup an automated process for generation of the resume output. Because I use GitLab for almost all of my projects I only needed to add a CI runner definition to my repository. Below is a snippet of the generation, which publishes to GitLab pages..gitlab-ci.ymlpages:\n  image: gbraad/docugen:latest\n  script:\n    - mkdir -p public\n    - pandoc -t html5 -o public/index.html resume.md\n  artifacts:\n    paths:\n    - public\nThe result of my resume gets published on GitLab at http://gbraad.gitlab.io/resume/ and syncs to GitHub, which hosts it at https://gbraad.nl/resume.PDF generation using Pandoc -> LaTeXPandoc can create nice looking PDF documents by using LaTeX. The handout of my OpenStack Hands-on-Lab was produced with this.$ pandoc -V geometry:margin=1in -o deploying-OpenStack.pdf deploying-openstack.md\nAlthough the results look really good, I had several issues with it:increased the size of the docugen container by more than a gigabyte.\n\nissues with properly rendering Chineseneeded additional installation of modules and fonts\n\n\nwould not respect width and margins for pre-formatted blocks\nLikely, all of them could be solved with some smart hacks, but I didn't have the time and interest to learn LaTeX. This felt to me like learning how to use XSLT to transform XML into something meaningful. I still have the packages installed in the container as some documents still use xelatex for the PDF generation.PDF generation using PhantomJSTo solve the issues mentioned above, I now use phantomjs. PhantomJS is a headless browser based on the WebKit rendering engine, and is scriptable with JavaScript. By using this approach I am able to use a single stylesheet to produce the same output on screen as on paper.var page = require('webpage').create(), system = require('system'),\n    address = system.args[1], output = system.args[2];\npage.viewportSize = { width: 600, height: 600 };\npage.paperSize = { format: \"A4\", orientation: 'portrait', margin: '1cm' };\nif(system.args.length > 3) { page.zoomFactor = system.args[3]; }\npage.open(address, function (status) {\n   page.render(output);\n   phantom.exit();\n});\nTo generate a PDF, I call:$ phantomjs topdf.js resume.html resume.pdf\nPage breaksTo produce a nicer result, I have also added the following to my stylesheet:\nh1 {\n  page-break-before: always;\n}\n\n#gerard-braad {\n  text-align: center;\n  page-break-before: avoid;\n}\nWhen printed this inserts a page break before the header starts. So when a new topic starts, but avoids it for the start of the document.ConclusionGenerating a document from plaintext using Markdown can be beneficial. The source will never suffer from issues with 'being unreadable' or 'deprecated software', and it can easily be indexed. Tracking changes and even publishing a change is not as easy as opening the file on my mobile phone, and commiting it using git. Automatically the result will be published.I have moved all my documentation over to plaintext, from the handsonlabs, training and teaching material, schedules, etc. I am still tweaking some of the processes, but the convenience is that a single source material can be used for different outputs. For instance, I publish my articles of this blog in Markdown, as generated documents, and as a GitBook.Do not settle for a solution forever. Over time requirements can change and new insights can be utilized to produce a better solution.LinksSource of my resume: GitLab, GitHub\n\nPublished version\n\nEndnotesI looked for some of the older formats and output, but was unable to track them down. I do remember my businesscard was used as a reference for 'microformats'. And someone tried to introduce an XML standard for resume, called xmlresume if I recall correctly. From experience I could conclude this would not work; no applicant will provide XML and converting it in a tool seems pointless.At the moment I am still looking for a nice tool on Android to edit the documents. I use SGit with Writeily Pro, but I am a little disappointed in both tools. Opening a file for viewing in sgit will modify the file, and it does not deal well with resetting this. And Writeily Pro becomes slow over time when editing a file. Closing it and re-opening solves this, but it breaks the writing streak. Sometimes I rather use DroidEdit, as it is just a text editor and does not suffer from this issue. Tools on the iPad, like Daedalus Touch and Textastic feel more productive.

No no, let me say it this way, you are responsible to come up with ideas to improve a situation, make it more efficient. Or, in other words, you have to have a lot of knowledge and a certain way of thinking, being analytical. Simple. But knowledge is something you can develop. And one thing you always have to have on mind. You are responsible for your own personal development...I have been employed by two companies that were very strong on this; Sogyo and ThoughtWorks. Both are solution providers, mostly focussed on the software. They both used agile methodologies, development practices, like pair programming, cod reviews, etc. All to ensure the delivery of excellence. Especially this, the delivery of quality and outstanding results, expected that engineers keep themselves up-to-date. They reserved time for this and organized meetups, for personnel and the software development community. I have learned a lot from this, but one thing that both of them did was allowing you a mentor (or sponsor).This is not a coach that helps you to find your way around the company in the first few weeks or months, but a person that helps you with career development. It is not that he or she defines targets, but sits down with you and discuss about issues you face, knowledge gaps you might have, etc. My mentor at Sogyo, Edwin van Dillen, has been very inspirational. It made me want to mentor other people... and this what I do now for new contributors to Open Source, and software communities in general. Always, when you can, look for a mentor. Someone who can help you along the way to improve yourself. But improvement is also something you can do yourself. Never stop learning. We call this Continuous Improvement.So, one of the things I often get is the question of 'what should I read'? I generally do not promote books that much, as a lot of technology books are dated by the time they are printed. I'd rather refer to a good blog post or living content that gets updated regularly. However, there is always this list of books that are timeless. They have been inspirational or defining in the knowledgd they provide. And this is something I want to start adding to my blog, a review or discussion of a book that helped me in my career. Books that I even bought again either as ePub or PDF after I moved to the other side of the world. I started to compile a list on my Knowledge Base* repository as a reference to others, but thought I would be a better idea to post them here with a short intro. So, look for the next post in the category 'Books'."},"0016-object-design.html":{"url":"0016-object-design.html","title":"Object Design","keywords":"","body":"One of the books I got recommended early in my career was Object Design: Roles, Responsibilities, and Collaborations by Rebecca Wirfs-Brock and Alan McKean. The topic of this book is OOD (Object-Oriented Design). It is a wordy book, which could certainly could have been shorter, but the content makes certainly up for this issue. This write-up is based on reading this book many years ago, so bear with me if things are not completely in line with the book. Although, the knowledge in this book certainly has contributed to this point-of-view. I currently own a copy of this book as reference in a digital format.The author, Rebecca Wirfs-Brock, is a software engineer and consultant in Object-Oriented Design, and as the title suggests the book details about the design of your object model and how it interacts with other objects.One of the things you will learn when creating software, is that design of the  interactions and relations between objects and classes probably is one of the most important and hardest things. Luckily, software design and development is an evolutionary process. You will not get it right he first time and you also shouldn't aim for this. What can be modeled today as a variable on an object today, might become a class itself in the future. If you would design this from day one, you probably over-design the software and implement functionality that might never be needed.What I learned from this book is how this interaction and collaboration between objects happen. Where do I keep the state? who can make a change? If the object can encapsulate it, this is probably where it should live. Ask yourself, why would another object need to know about the information, and whose responsibility is it? The book details as far as I remember CRC-cards (Class Reponsibility Rollaboration) and shows a method to get this clear. In my work I have never created the actual cards, but the concept behind it is very valuable. Get this book and browse through it, keep a copy as a reference. It is well worth it.More information about this book can be found in my Knowledge Base entry."},"0017-kubernetes-ansible.html":{"url":"0017-kubernetes-ansible.html","title":"Deploying Kubernetes using Ansible","keywords":"","body":"Recently I did a lot of tests with Atomic, such as a creating custom images for Ceph, and ways to provide an immutable infrastructure. However, Atomic is meant to be a host platform for a container platform using Kubernetes. Their Getting Started guide describes how to setup a basic environment to host containerized applications. However, this is a manual approach and with the help of Vincent* I create a way to deploy this Kubernetes environment on Atomic and a standard CentOS installation using Ansible. In this article I will describe the components and provide instructions on how to deploy this basic environment yourself.RequirementsTo deploy the Kubernetes environment you will need either Atomic Host or a standard CentOS installation. If you are using this for testing purposes, a cloud image on an OpenStack provider will do. The described Ansible scripts will work properly on both Atomic Host and CentOS cloud images. Although it has not been tested on Fedora, it should be able to make this work with minimal changes. If you do, please contribute these changes back.You will need at least 2 (virtual) machines. One will be configured as the Kubernetes master and the remaining node(s) can be configured as minions or deployment nodes. I have used at least 4 nodes; a general controller node to perform the deployment from (also configured to install the Kubernetes client), a master node and at least two deployment nodes. Take note that this deployment does not handle docker-storage-setup and High Availability.Setup for deploymentAlmost all the deployments I perform are initiated from a short-lived controller node. This is a machine that allows\nincoming and outgoing traffic, and mostly gets configured with an external Floating IP. This host can be seen as a jumphost. I will configure it with a dedicated set of SSH keys for communication with the other machines. You do not have to do this, and if you have limited resources, consider this host to be the same as the Kubernetes master node.On this machine do the following:$ yum install -y ansible git\n$ git clone https://gitlab.com/gbraad/ansible-playbook-kubernetes.git\n$ cd ansible-playbook-kubernetes\n$ ansible-galaxy install -r roles.txt\nThis will install the Ansible playbook and the required roles:gbraad.docker\ngbraad.docker-registry\ngbraad.kubernetes-master\ngbraad.kubernetes-node\ngbraad.kubernetes-client\nEach of the roles take care of the installation and/or configuration of the environment. Do take note that the Docker and Kubernetes roles do not install packages on the Atomic hosts as these already come with the needed software.Configure the deploymentIf you look at the files deploy-kubernetes.yml you will see three tasks for a different group of hosts. As mentioned before, they will each take care of the installation when needed.- name: Deploy kubernetes Master\n  hosts: k8s-master\n  remote_user: centos\n  become: true\n  roles:\n  - gbraad.docker\n  - gbraad.kubernetes-master\n\n- name: Deploy kubernetes Nodes\n  hosts: k8s-nodes\n  remote_user: centos\n  become: true\n  roles:\n  - gbraad.docker\n  - gbraad.kubernetes-node\n\n- name: Install kubernetes client\n  hosts: k8s-client\n  remote_user: centos\n  become: true\n  roles:\n  - gbraad.kubernetes-client\nTake notice of the setting of remote_user. On an Atomic host this is a passwordless sudo user, which can also login with SSH using a passwordless key-based authentication. If you use CentOS, please configure a user and allow add an entry with echo \"username ALL=(root) NOPASSWD:ALL\" > /etc/sudoers.d/username.Change the inventoryAnsible targets a playbook against a single or group of nodes that you specify in an inventory file. This file is named hosts in this playbook repository. When you open it you will see the same set of names as specified above in the hosts entry in the deploy-kubernetes.yml playbook. For our purposes you will always have to deploy a master and a node. If you do not specify the master node, the installation will fail as some of the deployment variables will be used for configuration of the nodes.$ vi hosts\n[k8s-master]\natomic-01 ansible_ssh_host=10.5.0.11\n\n[k8s-nodes]\natomic-02 ansible_ssh_host=10.5.0.14\natomic-03 ansible_ssh_host=10.5.0.13\natomic-04 ansible_ssh_host=10.5.0.12\nGroup variablesAt the moment the roles are not very configurable as they are mainly targeting a simple test environment. Inside the folder group_vars you will find the configration for the Kubernetes nodes. These are as followsskydns_enable: true\ndns_server: 10.254.0.10\ndns_domain: kubernetes.local\nPerform the deploymentAfter changing the variables in the hosts inventory file and the group variables, you are actually all set to perform the deployment. We will start with the following.$ ansible-playbook -i hosts deploy-docker-registry.yml\nThis first step will install Docker on the master node and pull the Docker Registry container. This is needed to provide a local cache of container images that you have pulled.After this we can install the Kubernetes environment with:$ ansible-playbook -i hosts deploy-kubernetes.yml\nBelow I will describe what each part of the playbook does and some information about the functionality.Playbook and role descriptionBelow I will give a short description of what each part of the playbook and role does.Role gbraad.dockerEach node in the playbook will be targeted with the following role: gbraad.docker. This role determines if the node is an Atomic Host or not. This check is performed in the tasks/main.yml file. It the node is not an Atomic Host, it will include install.yml to perform additional installation tasks. At the moment this is a simple package installation for docker. After this step, the role will set state started and enabled for the services; docker.SourceRole: gbraad.kubernetes-masterAs part of the playbook, first we will configure the master node. For this, the role gbraad.kubernetes-master is used. Just like in the previous role, file tasks/main.yml will perform a simple check to determine if an Atomic Host is used or not. If not, some packages will be installed:kubernetes-master\n\nflannel\n\netcd\n\nSourceConfigure KubernetesAfter this step Kubernetes will be configured on this hosts. Tasks are described in the file tasks/configure_k8s.yml, source.RoleCongfigure Kubernetes: etcdThis role will create a single 'etcd' server on the master. For simplicty all IP address will be allowed by using 0.0.0.0 as the endpoint. The port used for etcd clients is 2379, but since 4001 is also widely used we will also configure to use this.Tasks:Configure etcd LISTEN CLIENTS\n\nConfigure etcd ADVERTISE CLIENTS\n\nConfigure Kubernetes: common servicesAfter this the role will set an entry in the file /etc/kubernetes/config. This is a general configuration file used by all the services. It sets the local IP address, identified as default_ipv4_address as etcd server and the kubernetes master nodes.Tasks:Configure k8s common services\n\nConfigure Kubernetes: apiserverFor the apiserer the file /etc/kubernetes/apiserver is used. We will configure it to listen on all IP address. An admission control plug-in is a piece of code that intercepts requests to the Kubernetes API server prior to persistence of the object. For this role we removed ServiceAccount which is normally used to limit the creation requests of Pods based on the service account.Restart servicesAfter this the services of the master node are started and enabled. These are:etcd\n\nkube-apiserver\n\nkube-controller-manager\n\nkube-scheduler\n\nConfigure flannelFor this environment we will use flannel to provide an overlay network. An overlay network exists on top of another network to provide a virtual path between nodes who use this overlay network. The steps for this are specified in tasks/configure_flannel.yml source.The configuration of flannel is controller by etcd. We will copy a file to the master node containing:{\n  \"Network\": \"172.16.0.0/12\",\n  \"SubnetLen\": 24,\n  \"Backend\": {\n    \"Type\": \"vxlan\"\n  }\n}\nThis file is located in the role as files/flanneld-conf.json. Using curl we will post this file to etcd on the master.Tasks:Copy json with network config\n\nConfigure subnet\n\nAfter these steps the Kubernetes master is configured.Role: gbraad.kubernetes-nodeFor the configuration of a Kubernetes node we use the role gbraad.kubernetes-node. Just like in the previous roles we determine in tasks/main.yml to install packages or not. For all the nodes we will configure:SELinux\n\nflannel\n\nkubernetes specific settings\n\nSource, RoleConfigure SELinuxBecause I use persistent storage using NFS with Docker, I configure SELinux to set the boolean virt_use_nfs.Configure flannelIn the tasks:Overlay | configure etcd url\n\nOverlay | configure etcd config key\n\nFlannel systemd | create service.d\n\nFlannel systemd | deploy unit file\n\nWe configure all the nodes to use the etcd instance on k8s-master as the endpoint for flannel configuration. These tasks configure the networking to use the flanneld provided bridge IP and MTU settings. Using the last two tasks we configure systemd to start the service.After this change we will restart the flanneld service.Configure KubernetesIn the file tasks/configure_k8s.yml we do final configuration of the Kubernetes node to point it to the master node.In the tasks:k8s client configuration\n\nk8s client configuration | KUBELET_HOSTNAME\n\nk8s client configuration | KUBELET_ARGS\n\nwe configure how the node is identified.In the tasks:k8s client configuration | KUBELET_API_SERVER\n\nConfigure k8s master on client | KUBE_MASTER\n\nwe set the location of the API server and the master node. Both of these will point to the IP address of the k8s-master.After this change we will restart the kubelet and kube-proxy service.After deploymentIf all these tasks succeeded, you should have a working Kubernetes deployment. In the next steps we will perform some simple commands to verify if the environment works.Deploy client and verify environmentAs you have noticed from the hosts inventory file, there is a possibility to specify a client host:[k8s-client]\ncontroller ansible_ssh_host=10.5.0.3\nYou do not have to deploy a kubernetes client using this playbook. It will install a single package, but you could also just use the statically compiled Go binary that is provided from the Kubernetes releases:$ wget http://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.3.4/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl\n$ chmod +x kubectl\nVerify nodesOncae all the nodes have been deployed using the playbook, you canb verify communication. From a client node you can perform the following command:$ kubectl --server=10.5.0.11:8080 get node`\nNAME             LABELS    STATUS\n10.5.0.12            Ready\n10.5.0.13            Ready\n10.5.0.14            Ready\nSchedule workloadIf all looks good, you can schedule a workload on the environment. The following commands will create a simple nginx instance.$ vi kube-nginx.yml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: www\nspec:\n  containers:\n    - name: nginx\n      image: nginx\n      ports:\n        - containerPort: 80\n          hostPort: 8080\nThis file described a Pod with a container called nginx using the 'nginx' image. To schedule it, do:$ kubectl --server=10.5.0.11:8080 create -f kube-nginx.yml\npods/www\nUsing the following command you can check the status:$ kubectl --server=192.168.124.40:8080 get pods\nPOD       IP            CONTAINER(S)   IMAGE(S)   HOST                            LABELS    STATUS    CREATED      MESSAGE\nwww       172.16.59.2                             10.5.0.12/10.5.0.12                 Running   52 seconds\n                        nginx          nginx                                                Running   24 seconds\nIf you now open a browser pointing to the node Kubernetes used to create it (http://10.5.0.12:8080/), you will see an nginx welcome page.ConclusionSetting up Kubernetes can be a daunting task as there are many different components involved. Kelsey Hightower has a very good guide, called Kubernetes The Hard Way that will teach you how to deploy kubernetes manually on different cloud providers, such as AWS and the Google Compute Engine. After gaining some experience, it is advised to look at automation to deploy an environment, such as the the Ansible scripts that can be found in the contrib repository of Kubernetes. this allows you to stand up an environment with High Availability. The scripts described in this article should only serve as an introduction to gain understanding what is needed for a Kubernetes environment.If you want a production-ready environment, please have a look at OpenShift. OpenShift deals with setting up a cluster of kubernetes nodes, scheduling workload and most important, how to set up images for deployment. This is done using what is called 'source to image'. This and OpenShift itself will be the topic of future articles.More informationKnowledge-base article about Kubernetes on Atomic\n\nKnowledge-base article about Kubernestes\n\nHands-on-Lab: Kubernetes on OpenStack (Not all material published yet)\n\nDeploying Kubernetes on Atomic hosts\n\n"},"0018-openshift-cluster-up.html":{"url":"0018-openshift-cluster-up.html","title":"Deploying OpenShift","keywords":"","body":"In my previous article I described how I used an Ansible playbook and a few roles\nto stand-up a Kubernetes test environment. In that article I mentioned that to\ndeploy a production-ready environment some work more was required. Luckily, it\nis now very easy to stand up a production and enterprise-ready container\nplatform for hosting applications, called OpenShift.\nThrough the years OpenShift has undergone a lot of changes, and the latest\nversion Origin v1.3 is very different from the original version. OpenShift sets\nup a complete Kubernetes environment and with a set of tools it can take care of\nthe whole application lifecycle, from source to deployment. In this article I\nwill give an introduction to setting up a test environment for a developer.Setup machineI will setup the environment on a standard Fedora 24 installation. You can use a\ncloud image as all the needed packages will be specified. After installing the\nmachine, you login as a standard user, which can do a password-less sudo.$ ssh fedora@89.42.141.96\n$ sudo su -\n#\nInstall docker and clientFrom here all the commands will be run as root, unless otherwise specified.$ dnf install -y docker curl\nThis will install the basic packages we need to setup the test cluster. Now from\na browser you open the following page: https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/tag/v1.3.0.\nThis shows the current deliverables for the OpenShift Origin v1.3 release. You\nneed to download the file called like openshift-origin-client-tools-v1.3.0-[...]-linux-64bit.tar.gz$ curl -sSL https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/download/v1.3.0/openshift-origin-client-tools-v1.3.0-3ab7af3d097b57f933eccef684a714f2368804e7-linux-64bit.tar.gz -o oc-client.tar.gz\n$ tar -zxvf oc-client.tar.gz\n$ mkdir -p /opt/openshift/client\n$ cp ./openshift-origin-client-tools-v1.3.0-3ab7af3d097b57f933eccef684a714f2368804e7-linux-64bit/oc /opt/openshift/client/oc\n\nNote: I do not install the binary in /usr/bin or /usr/sbin to prevent a\nconflict with a packaged version, but also because this makes it easier for me\nto work on a different version of the application. E.g. the current packaged\nversion is v1.2 and does not provide the command we will be using in the next\nstep.Configure dockerTo allow OpenShift to pull and locally cache images, it will deploy a local\ndocker registry. But before docker would be able to use this, we need to\nspecify an insecure registry in the configuration. For this you need to add\n--insecure-registry 172.30.0.0/16 to /etc/sysconfig/docker.$ vi /etc/sysconfig/docker\nOPTIONS='--selinux-enabled --log-driver=journald --insecure-registry 172.30.0.0/16'\nAfter this we will setup to allow the standard user to communicate with the\ndocker daemon over the docker socket. This is not a necessary step, and does not\nmake the system more secure. It does make it easier not having to move between\nuser and using sudo all the time.$ groupadd docker\n$ usermod -a -G docker fedora\n$ chgrp docker /var/run/docker.sock\nEdit: I recently created an Ansible playbook\nto perform these steps, as I had to do this on several Atomic hosts. I uses the\ncurrent Ansible user and adds it to a group, and changes the socket permissions.After this you can start docker and move on the actual installation of OpenShift.$ systemctl enable docker\n$ systemctl start docker\nNote: we will be running this environment with devicemapper as Storage Driver.\nThis is not an ideal situation. If you do further tests, consider changing the\nstorage with docker-storage-setup to use a dedicated volume.Running OpenShiftSince version 1.3 of OpenShift, the client provides a cluster up commands\nwhich stands up a very simple all-in-one cluster, with a configured registry,\nrouter, image streams, and default templates.As the fedora user, you can check if you can access docker$ docker ps\nCONTAINER ID    IMAGE   COMMAND     CREATED     STATUS      PORTS   NAMES\nNo containers should be returned. This mean you can communicate with the docker\ndaemon. Now you are ready to start the test cluster.cluster up$ export PATH=$PATH:/opt/openshift/client/\n$ ./oc cluster up\n-- Checking OpenShift client ... OK\n-- Checking Docker client ...

If you want to change\nyou can login using:$ oc login\nThe standard user provided is developer.VerifyNow we need to verify if we can deploy a simple application. However, without\nchanges, OpenShift will not run containers with a root-user process. For example\nan nginx container would fail with a permission denied error.Instead, we will for now run a simple Hello container:$ oc run hello-openshift --image=docker.io/openshift/hello-openshift:latest --port=8080 --expose\nservice \"hello-openshift\" created\ndeploymentconfig \"hello-openshift\" created\nThis would create the container and schedule it.

This is not needed for our verification.To check the application, we need to get the IP address that has been assigned\nto the Pod. You can do this as follows:$ oc get pod hello-openshift-1-xi7f0 -o yaml | grep podIP\n  podIP: 172.17.0.7\nAll you have to do now is open the endpoint:$ curl 172.17.0.7:8080\nHello OpenShift!\nAnd that is it, you have a working OpenShift test cluster.TeardownIf you are down with this, you simply do a:$ oc cluster down\nand all the containers used in the deployment will be torn down.ConclusionUsing OpenShift's cluster up command you can easily setup an environment for\ndevelopers to run and test their applications. The current of OpenShift\nprovided with Fedora 24 does not offer this command, as the packaged version is\nv1.2. However, this change is in Rawhide and is therefore expected to be\nreleased as part of Fedora 25.In future articles I will detail more about how to create applications for the\nOpenShift container platform, and how to check and maintain the life cycle of\nthe deployed application.

Especially in the case of Fedora cloud images, no special\nconfiguration is done to the image. While Atomic images come pre-configured with\na dedicated pool. Using devicemapper with loopback can lead to unpredictable\nbehaviour, and while OverlayFS is a nice replacement, you will not be able to\nuse SELinux at the moment. In this short article I will show how to setup a pool\nfor storing the Docker images.PreparationFor this article I will be using a Fedora 24 installation on an OpenStack cloud\nprovider*. It is a standard Cloud image, which means the\nroot is configured as 'ext4'. I will be attaching a storage volume to the\ninstance. Just like using Virtual Manager, the disk will be identified as\n/dev/vdb.First you need to stop the Docker process and remove the existing location. This\nmeans you will loose the images, but if they are important, you can either\nexport or push them somewhere else.$ systemctl stop docker\n$ rm -rf /var/lib/docker\nAfter this we will create a basic LVM setup which will use the whole storage\nvolume.$ pvcreate /dev/vdb\n$ vgcreate docker_vol /dev/vdb\nWe know have a volumegroup named docker_vol.Setup Docker storageFedora comes with a tool that makes it easy to setup the storage for Docker,\ncalled docker-storage-setup.

In this article\nI will describe an example application from the sourcecode to the created image\nand how this gets deployed. The steps are explained using manual steps, and how\nOpenShift does it all automated. You will notice, at no point do you have to\nwrite a Dockerfile.PreparationFor this article it is not necessary to have a working test environment, however\nit does make things clearer. I would suggest you to use OpenShift Origin v1.3 on\nCentOS 7. Although my previous article showed how to get it up and running on\nFedora 24, I experienced an issue with deployment not succeeding*.\nThe steps in the deployment article can be performed by replacing dnf with\nyum.Description of the exampleThe OpenShift project publishes several test applications on GitHub, of which\none is a very simple Ruby applica8080. Please, have a look at: http://github.com/openshift/ruby-exYou will see it consists of four files:Gemfile\n\nGemfile.local\n\nconfig.ru\n\nREADME.md\n\nThe application itself is only described in config.ru and the needed dependencies\nare in Gemfile.DependenciesTo make the application work, we first need:$ gem install bundler\nThis will install bundler that can install dependencies as described in the\nGemfile. This file describes:source 'https://rubygems.org'\ngem 'rack'\ngem 'puma'\nThe first line says source which points to a gem repository, and each line\nstarting wih gem are bundled packages containing libraries for use in your\nproject. To install all of the required gems (dependencies) from the specified\nsources:$ bundle install\nThe file Gemfile.lock is a snapshot of the Gemfile and is used internally.config.ruThe application is specified in the file called config.ru. If you open the\nfile you will see it contains route mappings, lines starting  with map, for\nthree urls:/health\n\n/lobster\n\n/\n\n/healthThis is a commonly used to provide a simple health-check for applications that\nare automatically deployed. It allows to quickly test if the application got\ndeployed. In projects I worked on, we also did quick dependency checks, such as\na configuration file exists, or another needed endpoint is available. In this\napplication it will respond with a HTTP status code 200 and returns 1 as\nvalue./lobsterThis is a test provided by rack. It shows an ASCII-art lobster. By adding a\nvariable to the URL querystring ?flip=left the direction can be changed./This is the mapping to a bare route. It shows a greeting message on how to use\nthe application using OpenShift to trigger automated builds.RackupRack is an interface for using Ruby and Ruby frameworks with webservers. It\nprovides an application called rackup to start the application:$ bundle exec rackup -p 8080 config.ru\nUsing this command the webserver will bind to port 8080, according to the\ndescription in the config.ru file. To see what the mappings do, open:http://localhost:8080/health\n\nhttp://localhost:8080/lobster\n\nhttp://localhost:8080/\n\nUse the example with OpenShiftDeploying an application on OpenShift from source is very simple. A single\ncommand can do this. First have a look$ oc new-app openshift/ruby-20-centos7~https://github.com/[username]/ruby-ex\nBut before we do, I will explain what this command does. Oversimplified\nOpenShift does two things:Build\n\nDeploy\n\nNote: If you want to perform the command, go ahead. Please fork the repository\nand change the [username] in this command.Build: source to imageOpenShift runs container images which are in the Docker format. It will run\nthe CMD instruction for this. So, how does OpenShift know what to run?\nConvention. Most frameworks have a standard way of doing things, and this is\nas you noticed also the case with the Ruby example. The creation of the image\nhappens with a tool called source-to-image (S2I).Source-to-Image (S2I) is a toolkit and workflow for building\nreproducible Docker images from source code. It uses a base image, and will\nlayer the application on top, configures the runn command, which then results in\na containter image for use.$ s2i build https://github.com/[username]/ruby-ex openshift/ruby-20-centos7 ruby-ex\nbase imageThe base image here is openshift/ruby-20-centos7. The source\nof this image can be found at the following GitHub repository: s2i-ruby-containerIf you look at the Dockerfile source, you will see\nSoftware Collections is used to install a specific Ruby version.\nIn this case version 2.0. Software collections solves one of the biggest\ncomplaints of using CentOS (or RHEL) as a basis as part of your delivery. It\nallows you to use multiple versions of software on the same system, without\naffecting system-wide installed packages.The image also describes a label io.openshift.expose-services=\"8080:http\"\nwhich inidcate that the application on port 8080 will be exposed as HTTP\ntraffic. This also means the container does not need root privileges as the port\nassignment is above 1024. The application itself will be installed into the\nfolder: /opt/app-root/src.Running this container can be done with:$ docker run -p 8080:8080 ruby-ex\n[1] Puma starting in cluster mode...\n[1] * Version 3.4.0 (ruby 2.0.0-p645), codename: Owl Bowl Brawl\n[1] * Min threads: 0, max threads: 16\n[1] * Environment: production\n[1] * Process workers: 1\n[1] * Phased restart available\n[1] * Listening on tcp://0.0.0.0:8080\n[1] Use Ctrl-C to stop\n[1] - Worker 0 (pid: 32) booted, phase: 0\nOpen the links as previously stated will yield the same results.$ curl http://localhost:8080/health\nThe build process can be as simple as a copy for static content, to compiling\nJava or C/C++ code.  For the purpose of this article I will not explain more\nabout the S2I process, but this will certainly be explained in future articles.New applicationIf we now look at the previous command again:$ oc new-app openshift/ruby-20-centos7~https://github.com/[username]/ruby-ex\nyou can clear see the structure. The first element openshift/ruby-20-centos7\ndescribes the S2I container image for Ruby as hosted at the Docker hub. The\nsecond part is the source code path pointing to a git repository.Please try the command now... OpenShift will create containers for each of the\nstages used: build, deploy and the final running container. You can check\nthe containers using the command:$ oc get pod\nNAME               READY     STATUS         RESTARTS   AGE\nruby-ex-1-build    0/1       Completed      0          1m\nBuild stageIf you create this new application, a new container named ruby-ex-1-build.\nWhat happened is that the Source-to-image container got pulled which uses the \nbase image and layers the source code on top.To see what happened, as with the previous command, you can see the build\nconfiguration:$ oc logs bc/ruby-ex\nCloning \"https://github.com/gbraad/ruby-ex\" ...\n        Commit: f63d076b602441ebd65fd0749c5c58ea4bafaf90 (Merge pull request #2 from mfojtik/add-puma)\n        Author: Michal Fojtik \n        Date:   Thu Jun 30 10:47:53 2016 +0200\n---> Installing application source ...\n---> Building your Ruby application from source ...\n---> Running 'bundle install --deployment' ...\nFetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/...............\nInstalling puma (3.4.0)\nInstalling rack (1.6.4)\nUsing bundler (1.3.5)\nCannot write a changed lockfile while frozen.\nYour bundle is complete!\nIt was installed into ./bundle\n---> Cleaning up unused ruby gems ...\nPushing image 172.30.108.129:5000/myproject/ruby-ex:latest ...\nPushed 0/10 layers, 10% complete\nPushed 1/10 layers, 34% complete\nPushed 2/10 layers, 49% complete\nPushed 3/10 layers, 50% complete\nPushed 4/10 layers, 50% complete\nPushed 5/10 layers, 50% complete\nPushed 6/10 layers, 61% complete\nPushed 7/10 layers, 71% complete\nPushed 8/10 layers, 88% complete\nPushed 9/10 layers, 99% complete\nPushed 10/10 layers, 100% complete\nPush successful\nThe difference is that the resulting image will be placed in the myproject\nnamespace, and pushed to the local repository.Deployment stageAfter the image has been composed, OpenShift will run the container image on the\nscheduled node.

Note: The container\nruby-ex-1-deploy is not shown here as only the logs are of importance.The deployment configuration logs can be shown with:$ oc logs dc/ruby-ex\n[1] Puma starting in cluster mode...\n[1] * Version 3.4.0 (ruby 2.0.0-p645), codename: Owl Bowl Brawl\n[1] * Min threads: 0, max threads: 16\n[1] * Environment: production\n[1] * Process workers: 2\n[1] * Phased restart available\n[1] * Listening on tcp://0.0.0.0:8080\n[1] Use Ctrl-C to stop\n[1] - Worker 0 (pid: 32) booted, phase: 0\n[1] - Worker 1 (pid: 35) booted, phase: 0\nEventsTo see the flow of execution, you can have a look at:$ oc get events\nThis can be helpful if an error occured.VerifyNow that the application has been deployed on OpenShift, we need to look up the \nIP address that has been assigned. For this we use:$ oc get svc\nNAME      CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE\nruby-ex   172.30.91.160           8080/TCP   21h\nNow we can open the application as http://172.30.91.160:8080/ConclusionOpenShift allows you to run prebuilt images or applications based on source.\nThe Source-to-image tooling makes it possible to create reproducible images for\ndeployment of applications based on source. This tool itself is very helpful\nand is certainly something I will be using, even outside the use of OpenShift.\nThere is no need to create or modify a Dockerfile, which means that the\ndeveloper can focus on the development process.If you want to know more about the automated builds, please have a look at the\nREADME of the Ruby example.

But even Discovery Channel had many interruptions,\nsome were funny, or just\nslightly annoying, especially\nwhen you have the TV on as background sound.

There is a story behind every\nchoice people make, and in this article I will explain my vision and situation.\nThis is certainly not an employer review, but rather a reflection on past and\nmaybe future choices.Job-hoppingJust too often I have to explain why my resume looks like I have been hopping\nbetween jobs. Part of this is true and the other has a story behind it. I love a\nchallenge and also do not mind when a company hires me for my knowledge, but I\nalso prefer to be employed for a longer period and be able to work on the stuff\nthat matters. Work needs to be meaningful and satisfying...NetherlandsIn the Netherlands I worked for an employer which provides consultancy. This\noften involved on-site work. These clients, and consultants, like to work as\nclose as possible, as if you are employed by them. However, they keep the\nflexibility to end a contract when the project you are assigned on ends or has\nno budget. These assignments are usually short-term as they need hands or\nknowledge to finish it. If you know 'the Mythical Man-month', you know that\nintroducing engineers late in a project often does not work as expected.\nAlthough, wome of my assignments have dealt with longer term solutions, such as\nsoftware rewrite, knowledge hiring, etc. I loved my work as certainly felt very\nappreciated.ChinaAfter this, due to circumstances and a 'lost bet' with my wife, we moved to\nChina. Being employed in a foreign country involves sometimes with work of an\nimperfect nature.ProjectsOne of those is of having project based assignments, but unlike before I would\nbe directly hired by the employer. Which means that the contract will not last\nlonger than the allotted budget for the project. These project are challenging\nas they often deal with a new technology or a changed environment for the\nemployer. I have been on at least two projects here in China and have learned a\nlot from dealing with an inter-cultural environment and how to assist with\nadopting a more 'Western' approach to management (agile methodology).\nRe-assignments were discussed, but often involved a big change in work or other\nless than ideal propositions. If in that case there is no fit anymore, it is\nbest to move on. This choice would be in the best of interest of both the\nemployer and employee.StartupsThe other situation is when dealing with startups. Startups often require an\nemployee that is able to be all-round, as this allows to keep a minimal\nheadcount. Again, the work is mostly challenging and benefits a lot from\nmulti-disciplined engineers. I have worked for several startups, and most of\nthe cases it is very enjoyable work. The experience has led to some good\nsuccess stories, although some of them have also disappeared. The work includes\na lot of uncertainty. While some startups might look like they have matured,\nthey can still hide unpleasant surprises when dealing with management or\ndecision-making. This can have an affect on how the atmosphere will be at work.\nIt can be a happy place one-day... and a poisonous one the other day.RecruitersI understand an assessment of a possible match is difficult. There are probably\nmany applicants, long resumes to wade through. Automated system exist to deal\nwith analysing a 'match' based on the resume provided. And often, theese\nsystems fail to understand what people really meant to say or provide a picture\nof the working history. And I understand this is somehow needed.In my situation, the resume often happens to be sent to the local Chinese\nbranch. And here, my resume or application, disappears into an abyss; often the\nrecruiter does not reach out.RecommendationsIf you want to be employed into a group you like to work with, get noticed.\nWork with them, and show your passion. This is why I work on Open Source\nprojects. It is what I like most, as it involves technology, but also an\nessential soft skill (or perhaps a thick skin). Hopefully this can lead to a\nrecommendation. As this is still the best way to get hired.What I wantAt the moment I am looking for a new opportunity. As you have read, I am a\nsoftware engineer, but have worked in several different roles related to it.\nMulti-disciplinary and professional. Knows a lot about Linux, Open Source and\nChina. If you want to know more about me, please have a look at:Resume\n\nLinkedIn and the recommendations given.\n\nHomepage and my blog\n\nWhat I want is a great and challenging environment. This means that work is\nmeaningful and provides satisfaction. It should provide growth potential and\nunderstand that people need to focus on continuous improvement. Agile taught\nme one thing, we’re never really good enough. And third, and most important is\ntrust. Trust in colleagues, fairness and respect... without trust you can not\nhave a great work environment. But you also need trust that people dare to\nadmit when they are not experts at something yet, but you allow them to develop\nthemselves.Hope to hear from you.
